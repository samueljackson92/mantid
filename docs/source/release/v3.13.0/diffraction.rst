    putting new features at the top of the section, followed by
    improvements, followed by bug fixes.

Powder Diffraction
------------------

- Changing settings while running methods on the PEARL object no
  longer updates the default settings. Instead, initial settings are
  taken as the default, and any changes are reverted back to the
  default once the line they were made on has finished executing
- Focusing in texture-mode (160 banks) was enabled for GEM. The output
  is saved to the three-column MAUD format
- :ref:`PDCalibration <algm-PDCalibration>` has major upgrades including making use of :ref:`FitPeaks <algm-FitPeaks>` for the individual peak fitting
- New NOMAD instrument geometry for 2018 run cycle
- New POWGEN instrument geometry for 2018 run cycle
- New SNAP instrument geometry for 2018 run cycle

New Features
------------

- :ref:`LoadILLDiffraction <algm-LoadILLDiffraction>` is extended to apply vertical and horizontal tube alignment for D2B, based on the IPF.
- :ref:`PowderDiffILLDetEffCorr <algm-PowderDiffILLDetEffCorr>` is extended to compute the detector efficiencies also for the 2-dimensional scanning diffractometer D2B at the ILL.
- :ref:`PowderDiffILLDetEffCorr <algm-PowderDiffILLDetEffCorr>` is extended to provide automatic masking of the pixels with spurious calibration constants.
- :ref:`PowderDiffILLDetScanReduction <algm-PowderDiffILLDetScanReduction>` is extended to provide initial masking of the top and bottom parts of the tubes, and final masking of the 2D outputs.
- :ref:`WANDPowderReduction <algm-WANDPowderReduction>` performs powder diffraction data reduction for WANDÂ² with calibration, monitor normalisation and background subtraction.

Engineering Diffraction
-----------------------

- Improvements to the GSAS tab:

  - GSASIIRefineFitPeaks is now run asynchronously in the GUI, so the
    tab no longer locks when a refinement is run
  - A **Refine All** button was added to run refinement on every run
    loaded into the tab

- :ref:`GSASIIRefineFitPeaks <algm-GSASIIRefineFitPeaks>` now supports Pawley refinement as well as Rietveld
- HDF5 is now the standard format for saving data from the GUI:

  - Single peak fitting output is now saved as HDF5 instead of CSV,
    using :ref:`EnggSaveSinglePeakFitResultsToHDF5
    <algm-EnggSaveSinglePeakFitResultsToHDF5>`. The algorithm
    previously used for saving to CSV, **SaveDiffFittingAscii**, has
    been deprecated
  - Fit results and parameters are saved to HDF5 from the **GSAS
    Refinement** tab using :ref:`EnggSaveGSASIIFitResultsToHDF5
    <algm-EnggSaveGSASIIFitResultsToHDF5>`
  - After focusing, workspace sample logs are saved to HDF5 using
    :ref:`ExportSampleLogsToHDF5 <algm-ExportSampleLogsToHDF5>`

- The ``.nxs`` file from the Focus tab is now saved in the Focus directory with all the other focus output

:ref:`Release 3.13.0 <v3.13.0>`

Single Crystal Diffraction
--------------------------


- New algorithm :ref:`LoadDNSSCD <algm-LoadDNSSCD>` to load multiple single crystal diffraction data files from the DNS instrument into MDEventWorkspace.

- :ref:`SaveLauenorm <algm-SaveLauenorm>` now has input options for crystal system and reflection condition for lscale output instead of trying to determine from lattice parameters.

- :ref:`CreatePeaksWorkspace <algm-CreatePeaksWorkspace>` now accepts MD workspaces as input.

- New algorithms :ref:`LoadWANDSCD <algm-LoadWANDSCD>` and :ref:`ConvertWANDSCDtoQ <algm-ConvertWANDSCDtoQ>` to load single crystal HB2C data and convert it to either Q-sample or HKL space.

- New algorithm :ref:`IntegratePeaksProfileFitting <algm-IntegratePeaksProfileFitting>` to integrate peaks using 3D profile fitting in reciprocal space.

- New TOPAZ instrument geometry for 2018 run cycle

Improvements
############

- PeaksWorkspace has column added for the unique peak number so peaks can be found after sorting or filtering.

- :ref:`StatisticsOfPeaksWorkspace <algm-StatisticsOfPeaksWorkspace>` has option to use a weighted Z score for determining which peaks are outliers and has a new output workspace for plotting intensities of equivalent peaks.

Bug fixes
#########

- A bug was fixed in :ref:`FindSXPeaks <algm-FindSXPeaks>` that was causing the angular resolution parameters to give incorrect results when using the absolute comparision strategy.
